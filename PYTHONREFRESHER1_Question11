Q11. Sum of Indices

Problem Description

You are given a list of n integers and m queries, where each query consists of an index. You have to print for each query, the sum of numbers in the list from 0 to ith index for i in a query.

Input Format:

The first line consists of number of queries m
The next line consists of space separated integers consisting of elements of list
The next m lines consists of m queries in integer format
Output Format:

There will be m lines of output where each line consists of sum from 0th index to ith index in a query.
Sample Input:

2  
0 1 2 3
1  
3
Sample Output:

1  
6
Sample explanation:

For 1st query 1, the sum is 0+1 therefore 1 is printed. For the 2nd query, the sum is 0+1+2+3 therefore 6 is printed.

'''

m = int(input())
l = list(map(int, input().split(" ")))

#YOUR CODE GOES HERE
a=[]
c=[]
for k in range(0,m):
    c.append(int(input()))
for i in range(0,len(c)):
    sum=0
    for j in range(0,c[i]+1):
        sum=sum+l[j]
    a.append(sum)

for k in range(0,len(a)):
    print(a[k])
